"""NWS Current **Point** Flood Warnings.

This service provides a current listing of NWS Flood Warnings for forecast
points.  These are warnings that contain a HVTEC NWSLI, which is the forecast
point the NWS uses.  There is no archive support to this app, it is what
drives the data presentation on
[IEM Rivers](https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/rivers).

This service only provides the warnings for points that the NWS publishes
metadata for [here](https://www.weather.gov/vtec/Valid-Time-Event-Code).

The forecast warning point is included as an attribute ``latitude`` and
``longitude``, the actual geometries here are the polygons associated with
the warnings.
